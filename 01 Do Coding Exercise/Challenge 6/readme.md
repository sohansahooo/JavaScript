# Sum of First N Numbers Challenge

## Challenge
Can you calculate the sum of the first N numbers in a series? This challenge will help you practice using loops to accumulate a total.

## Explanation
In this challenge, you'll use a loop to sum up the numbers from 1 to N. Your task is to find the total sum of these numbers.

**Input:** 
- `N` (an integer representing the number of terms in the series)

**Output:** The sum of the numbers from 1 to N.

**Example:**
- **Input:** `N = 5`
- **Output:** `15` (because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15)

- **Input:** `N = 3`
- **Output:** `6` (because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6)

## Assignments
Test your skills with these summation challenges:

### 1. Total Savings

**Task:** Write a program to calculate the total savings if you save a fixed amount every day for N days. Assume you save a certain amount each day and calculate the total savings over N days.

**Input:** 
- `N` (an integer representing the number of days)
- `daily_savings` (a decimal number representing the amount saved each day)

**Output:** The total amount saved over N days.

**Example:**
- **Input:** `N = 7`, `daily_savings = 10`
- **Output:** `70` (because 10 * 7 = 70)

- **Input:** `N = 5`, `daily_savings = 20`
- **Output:** `100` (because 20 * 5 = 100)

### 2. Birthday Candles

**Task:** Write a program to calculate the total number of birthday candles needed if each year you add one candle for each additional year. Calculate the total number of candles needed from age 1 to age N.

**Input:** 
- `N` (an integer representing the age)

**Output:** The total number of candles needed.

**Example:**
- **Input:** `N = 4`
- **Output:** `10` (because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10)

- **Input:** `N = 6`
- **Output:** `21` (because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21)

### 3. Weekly Sales

**Task:** Write a program to calculate the total sales amount for a week if you have different sales each day. Sum the sales from each day to get the total weekly sales.

**Input:** 
- `sales` (an array of decimal numbers representing daily sales for the week)

**Output:** The total weekly sales amount.

**Example:**
- **Input:** `sales = [50.5, 60.0, 45.75, 70.25, 55.0, 80.0, 65.5]`
- **Output:** `427.0` (because 50.5 + 60.0 + 45.75 + 70.25 + 55.0 + 80.0 + 65.5 = 427.0)

- **Input:** `sales = [20.0, 30.0, 25.0, 40.0]`
- **Output:** `115.0` (because 20.0 + 30.0 + 25.0 + 40.0 = 115.0)
