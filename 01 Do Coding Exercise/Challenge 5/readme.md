# Common Numbers Challenge

## Challenge
Can you find the common numbers between two arrays? This challenge will help you practice using loops and conditionals to compare elements from multiple arrays.

## Explanation
In this challenge, you'll use loops to check which numbers appear in both of the given arrays. Your task is to identify these common numbers.

**Input:** 
- `array1` (an array of integers)
- `array2` (an array of integers)

**Output:** An array of common numbers between the two arrays, or an empty array if there are no common numbers.

**Example:**
- **Input:** `array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `array2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`
- **Output:** `[4, 5]`

- **Input:** `array1 = [1, 2, 3]`, `array2 = [4, 5, 6]`
- **Output:** `[]`

## Assignments
Test your skills with these array comparison challenges:

### 1. Find Common Names

**Task:** Write a program to find common names between two lists of names.

**Input:** `list1` (an array of strings) and `list2` (an array of strings)

**Output:** An array of common names.

**Example:**
- **Input:** `list1 = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]`, `list2 = ["Bob", "David", "Alice"]`
- **Output:** `["Alice", "Bob"]`

- **Input:** `list1 = ["Alice", "Bob"]`, `list2 = ["Charlie", "David"]`
- **Output:** `[]`

### 2. Find Common Courses

**Task:** Write a program to find common courses between two students' course lists.

**Input:** `courses_student1` (an array of course names) and `courses_student2` (an array of course names)

**Output:** An array of common course names.

**Example:**
- **Input:** `courses_student1 = ["Math", "Science", "History"]`, `courses_student2 = ["Science", "Art", "History"]`
- **Output:** `["Science", "History"]`

- **Input:** `courses_student1 = ["Math", "Biology"]`, `courses_student2 = ["Chemistry", "Physics"]`
