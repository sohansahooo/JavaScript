# Voting Eligibility Challenge

## Challenge
Can you determine if someone is eligible to vote based on their age? This challenge will help you get comfortable with using IF-ELSE statements.

## Explanation
In this challenge, you'll use an IF-ELSE statement to check if a person meets the minimum age requirement for voting. You can set this minimum age based on your countryâ€™s laws.

**Input:** 
- `age` (an integer representing the person's age)
- `min_age` (an integer representing the minimum voting age)

**Output:** "Eligible to vote" or "Not eligible to vote"

**Example:**
- **Input:** `age = 20, min_age = 18`
- **Output:** "Eligible to vote"

- **Input:** `age = 16, min_age = 18`
- **Output:** "Not eligible to vote"

## Assignments
Test your skills with these IF-ELSE programming challenges:

### 1. Driving Eligibility

**Task:** Write a program to check if a person can apply for a driving license based on age.

**Input:** `age` (an integer representing the person's age) and `min_driving_age` (an integer representing the minimum driving age)

**Output:** "Eligible for a driving license" or "Not eligible for a driving license"

**Example:**
- **Input:** `age = 17, min_driving_age = 16`
- **Output:** "Eligible for driving license"

- **Input:** `age = 14, min_driving_age = 16`
- **Output:** "Not eligible for driving license"

### 2. Senior Citizen Discount

**Task:** Write a program to check if a person is eligible for a senior citizen discount based on age.

**Input:** `age` (an integer representing the person's age) and `senior_age` (an integer representing the age to qualify as a senior citizen)

**Output:** "Eligible for senior citizen discount" or "Not eligible for senior citizen discount"

**Example:**
- **Input:** `age = 65, senior_age = 60`
- **Output:** "Eligible for senior citizen discount"

- **Input:** `age = 55, senior_age = 60`
